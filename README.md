### üåü Key Features

*   **Multi-Agent Workflow:** A `Researcher` agent analyzes a target company's website, and a `Copywriter` agent uses that research to craft a personalized email.
*   **Persistent Cloud Memory:** Utilizes **Qdrant Cloud** to store the results of agent work, creating a stateful system that learns over time.
*   **Vector-Based Caching:** Performs a vector similarity search to check for previous requests, enabling **instant recall** of cached results and saving on API costs.
*   **Full-Stack & Containerized:** Built with a Django/DRF backend and a React frontend, fully containerized with **Docker** and orchestrated with Docker Compose.
*   **Production-Ready Practices:** Served with Gunicorn and Nginx, demonstrating a modern, scalable deployment architecture.

### üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the application locally.

#### Prerequisites

*   **Docker Desktop** installed and running.
*   **Git** installed.
*   **OpenAI API Key**.
*   **Qdrant Cloud URL and API Key**.

#### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Create the environment file for the backend:**
    *   Navigate to the `agentic_project/` directory.
    *   Create a file named `.env`.
    *   Add your secret keys to this file:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-YourOpenAIKeyGoesHere"
    QDRANT_URL="https://your-qdrant-cluster-url.aws.cloud.qdrant.io:6333"
    QDRANT_API_KEY="YourQdrantAPIKeyGoesHere"
    ```

3.  **Build and run the application with Docker Compose:**
    *   Navigate back to the root `AGENT_OUTREACH/` directory.
    *   Run the magic command:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    The first build will take a few minutes. Subsequent builds will be much faster.

4.  **Access the application:**
    *   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

### üí° The Toughest Challenge: "Dependency Hell"

The most significant challenge was resolving a series of cascading dependency conflicts within the AI library stack. Manually pinning versions of `crewai`, `langchain`, and `openai` created an impossible situation for the package manager.

**Solution:** I overcame this by adopting a modern, flexible dependency strategy. I removed all non-essential version pins for the AI libraries in `requirements.txt` and updated the Python code to be compatible with the latest stable versions. This allowed `pip`'s dependency resolver to find a valid, working combination of packages and resulted in a more robust and maintainable project.
